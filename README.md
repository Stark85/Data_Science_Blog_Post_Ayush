## Project Motivation
For this project I used Stackoverflow survey data from 2017 to 2019 focusing only on Canada. The questions of interest are:

1. Among three programming languages which are mainly used in data science (Python, SQL, R) what percentage of Canadian participants worked with last year and desired to work with next year between 2017 and 2019? Did the salary changed over the years for each language?
2. Do Canadian developers with more professional coding experience and career satisfaction gain more salary?
3. Does salary increases with higher professional coding experience among Canadian developers if results are divided into male and female? How about ethnicity and organization size?
The answers to these questions can shed some light regarding the consistency of job market in Canada.
